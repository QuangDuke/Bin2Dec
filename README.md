# Bin2Dec
Binary to Decimal number converter 📌📌📌

Language used: Java (I shoulda used JavaScript for this repo but too late now 🤷‍♂️).

Personal self-coding-improvement project of a novice programmer. I'm getting ideas from: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas. Check them out ;)

Check the src folder within Bin2Dec for the code!

Feel free to give any constructive criticism, feedbacks, or suggestions.
